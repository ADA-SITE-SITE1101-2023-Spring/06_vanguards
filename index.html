			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Our team consists of three members, randomly selected by our professors Ms. Malak Gasimova and Mr. Araz Yusubov. 
                Babek Aliyev as our team leader is responsible for submitting our work, as well as controlling the deadlines for each member of the team, so that the work should be done about two days before the deadline. Also considering the distribution of work, Babek is involved in a portion of each project.
                Artem Abbasov and Tamella Orujaliyeva are responsible for completing the project portions, depending on the abilities of team members. As some of us are good at editing, some are better at writing reports. 
                To conclude, our team tries its best to maintain respect and care in any milestone or hardship that our team faced and will be facing.</p>
