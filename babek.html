    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>"I was born in 2004 on November 21 in Russia. There I went to school number 37. I was very noisy and hyperactive. In addition, I was very interested in encyclopedias. At the age of 7-8 years, I had already finished 2 encyclopedias."</p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>"When we moved to Azerbaijan, I went to school number 177 and graduated from it. I studied hard and wanted all my university classes to be in English. That's why I entered the ADA University. Here I study as a computer science student and learn everything about programming for my future job."</p>
    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>"I love to improve myself and play football. Every time we have free time with friends, we do not miss the opportunity to play football. Besides, I have hobbies like reading, watching movies and learning new things."</p>
