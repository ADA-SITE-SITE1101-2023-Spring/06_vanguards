    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>"I was born on the 21st of December in 2004. The first child in a family of five members (having two siblings). Growing up in my grandparents' house, as parents used to work most time. I grew up as a quiet kid outside, however, the curiosity and creativity inside of me were dynamically powerful." </p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>"Having an interest in all subjects, from kindergarten I was enrolled in a Russian sector class in school number 145.  Then since seventh grade, I have studied in school number 32. For continuation of education in English, I was enrolled in ADA School to study my last year. Eventually, getting into ADA University, I took my major in Computer Engineering, currently studying my first year."" </p>
    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>"I am interested in science, especially physics, and astronomy. Apart from that most of the time I am devoting to psychiatry. Moreover, philosophy and other social sciences have a special place in my heart. Drawing was one of the hobbies that I have maintained since my toddler years, which evolved into a love for art in general."</p>
